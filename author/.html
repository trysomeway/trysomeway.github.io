    <p>Today in the morning, when I walked with my dog, one neighbor proposed take part in creating of dirt track. The car will come and need help with unloading, I&nbsp;agree.</p>
<p>Comes maybe 10 - 15 men, all have enthusiastic to help and smiling. It is interesting, because one off part of this track was make before and I think it is cool and now I am with them. Man how to invite me buy material for self many. Need said that he planted whole lawn near of river. And because of this, garages were not built on this&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>We finished work after about 25 minutes. We still have empty bags and some neighbor say we have all that need to cleaning work and we start. Interesting that I really want this but think I will be look like strange man&#8230; and now when all this do it is really cool. Special for me was important to clean bank of the river it was so natural, although at work I find a lot of junk and 2 hryvnias too&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>What I want to say sometime the most important to start. And maybe be it may turn out that it was a dream of&nbsp;many.</p>
